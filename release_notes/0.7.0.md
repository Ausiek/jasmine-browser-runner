# Release Notes

## Summary

This is a development release of jasmine-browser-runner that includes improved
ES module support, better error handling, and changes to how custom reporters
are configured.

## Supported environments

jasmine-browser-runner 0.7.0 has been tested in the following environments.

| Environment       | Supported versions |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Node              | 14, 16             |
| Safari            | 8-14               |
| Chrome            | 91                 |
| Firefox           | 90, 68, 78         |
| Edge              | 91                 |
| Internet Explorer | 10, 11             |


## Breaking changes

* Node <14 is no longer supported.

* Relative reporter paths are resolved from the current working directory, not
  the lib directory of the jasmine-browser-runner package.
  
* Custom reporters can be defined in ES modules.
  
  Reporter modules are now loaded via dynamic import() instead of require(),
  so they can be either ES modules or CommonJS. As before, the module's
  default export is expected to be a constructor that can be called without
  arguments and returns a reporter.
  
  Reporter names specified in config files and via the --reporter CLI arg now
  need to conform to the rules for ES module import specifiers:
  <https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_import_specifiers>. This applies even if
  the reporter is a CommonJS module. In practice this means that some users may
  need to append '.js' to their reporter names.
  
* Module subpaths (e.g. jasmine-browser-runner/lib/server) can no longer be 
  imported.


## New features

* Better diagnostics for missing or invalid config properties.
* Configured reporters can be instances, not just strings.
* .js config files are supported. They can be either CommonJS or ES modules.


## Bugfixes

* Don't leak a browser if the server fails to start.
* Output the correct command to reproduce a random seed.
* Fixed config loading on Windows.


## Internal improvements

* Dogfood jasmine-npm's `jsLoader: "import"` setting.
* Renamed executable to match how NPM will actually install it.
